# Banking System

A simple Python-based Banking System demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts.

## Features

- Account management using classes and inheritance
- Savings Account with interest calculation
- Current Account with overdraft limit
- Display account details with relevant information

## How It Works

- The system defines a base `Account` class and two derived classes: `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount`.
- Each account type has specific attributes and methods (e.g., interest rate for savings, overdraft limit for current).
- Account details can be displayed, and interest can be applied to savings accounts.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python "Banking system.py"
   ```
3. The script will create a sample `CurrentAccount` and display its details.

## Example Output

```
Account No: C456, Balance: 2000, Overdraft Limit: 5000
```

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
